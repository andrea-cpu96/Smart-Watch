Images are compressed in order to save space.


****** MCU BLOCKS ******


MCU (Minimum COded Unit) is the smallest unit of data that JPEG processes at one time.

It consists of a block of image data in YCbCr format. 

The exact composition of an MCU depends on the chrominance subsampling scheme used. 

1) 4:4:4 Subsampling:

	No subsampling. Each pixel has full resolution for Y, Cb, and Cr.
	An MCU typically contains 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Y, 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Cb, and 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Cr.

2) 4:2:2 Subsampling:

	Horizontal subsampling by a factor of 2 for Cb and Cr.
	An MCU typically contains 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Y, 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Cb, and 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Cr.
	However, the Cb and Cr blocks cover only half the horizontal resolution compared to Y. So effectively, for every two Y blocks 	horizontally, there is one Cb block and one Cr block.

3) 4:2:0 Subsampling:

	Horizontal and vertical subsampling by a factor of 2 for Cb and Cr.
	An MCU typically contains 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Y, 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Cb, and 1 block of 8x8 pixels for Cr.
	Here, the Cb and Cr blocks cover half the horizontal and half the vertical resolution compared to Y. So effectively, for every 	four Y blocks, there is one Cb block and one Cr block.

So in any case an MCU block is 3*8*8 = 192 BYTES in space, but in 1) it rappresents 8*8 pixels, in 2) 16*8 pixels and in 3) 16*16 pixels.


****** YCbCr SUBSAMPLING ******


An image is reppresented according to the RGB format, but, in order to save space, a conversion to YCbCr format is done 
during JPEG compression.
 
Y; luminance
Cb; blue-difference chrominance
Cr; red-difference chrominance

Human eyes are more sensible to the Y component, so Cb and Cr compenents can be reduced in order to save space without significantly 
affecting affecting the perceived image quality. 

This process is called CHROMINANCE SUBSAMPLING.

J; width of the reference block (usually 4)
a; number of chrominance samples in the first row of the block
b; number of chrominance samples in the second row of the block

JPEG_444_SUBSAMPLING; means NO CHROMINANCE SUBSAMPLING is performed.
-> J = 4 ; a = 4 ; b = 4
-> higher quality, but more space and more processing complexity

Other formats are 4:2:2 and 4:2:0.

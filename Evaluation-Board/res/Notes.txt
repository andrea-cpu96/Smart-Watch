I'm planning to design a custom evaluation board in order to test specific components for the digital watch project.

The board should have the following components;

- stm32f767 microcontroller

	This microcontroller is an alternative to the stm32h747 that I used for the first prototype.
	It is a SINGLE CORE and in a LQFP package which is smaller than the other.
	It also has the JPEG hardware codec within.

	I need to check if this microcontroller is compatible with my code. Specifically the LINKER FILE (memory structure) and 	its PINOUT. 
	
- External SDRAM
	
	This component is used as computational memory, i.e. a memory where video data are saved during computation time.	
- SDport

- Battery management system 

- STlink programmer

- micro-USB port
	
	A micro-USB port is used both for programming andfor battery charging. 

- other components (power supply regulators and filters)

	An BOOST CONVERTER could be necessary in order to increase the battery voltage.
	The battery provides 3.7V which could be too low also for an LDO regulator, expecially when the battery level falls.

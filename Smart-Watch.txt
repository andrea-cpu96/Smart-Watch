SMART-WATCH

Introduction

- This project consists on the development of a smart-watch able to play a video with 24h-loop sequence.

Requirements

- Round display
- Battery
- SD-car reader 
- SD driver for video

Battery

- I need a battery able to supply enougth power for video applications. 
- At least it should last about 24h
- Rechargeble 
- Small 

-> 402035; 37x4 mm, 400 mAh, 3.7 V, 5C, rechargeble 
-> micro-USB 

Display

- Round
- Colours (TFT or OLED)
- 3.3 V supply
- At least 24 FPS
- Dimensions for normal wrist

Video

- Video has to be compressed in order to save memory space (2h video uncompressed are about 1000 GB of space at 8-bit 1080P, 24 FPS)

- There are differents CODEC formats for coding and decoding videos. I have to care about the decoding part because the coding should be already done while the microcontroller has to implement the decoding in Real time.

- H264 is one format used by moderm television it has good performances, but it requires lot of processing capabilities.

-> MJPEG is a standard which uses various complete frames in sequence. Lower quality then H264 and highr memory required, but less processing needed. 
-> I need a method to create this kind of file starting from an MP4.


Consumptions 

- SD-Card requires up to 100mA for write operations (I don't know how much requires for read operation)


NOTES

- A pull-up on the DO cannot be omited, or some cards will fail initialization process.
- SD card from 4GB to 32GB are of different types and are considered SDHC (High  Capacity), they work different.
- FAT is the File System used by SD-Cards 
- MMC/SDC employs NAND Flash Memory.  Generally the flash memory requires to erase existing data prior to re-write a new data, and minimum unit of erase operation, called erase block, is larger than write block size.
- Larger memory cards happen to be slower than smaler ones. 
- Not all the SD-cards support the SPI mode. SD-Cards have their own native mode, SPI is an option.
